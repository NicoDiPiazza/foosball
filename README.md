# foosball

a, s, d, f to select your paddles, q to quit the game, r to serve the ball position (a "foos" as the youth say), and UP and DOWN arrows to control where your paddles go

This is the base for a computer version of the classic game foosball. It is nearing completion.Future plans include a scoring system, AI opponents or human ones, up to to the user to decide, more detailed collision, and nice art/sprites, made by yours truly. This is part of a larger project intended for training a Neural network, probably of the NEAT variety, not Deep Q, to play foosball. It is currently somewhat commented, and this situation will be improved. TL;DR It's  still a WIP
