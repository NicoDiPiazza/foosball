# foosball
This is the base for a computer version of the classic game foosball. As of right now it is very incomplete, with basic paddle movement, no collision, and no detail. However, this should be remedied in the future, with a scoring system, AI opponents or human ones, up to to the user to decide, clean collision, and nice art/sprites, made by yours truly. This is part of a larger project intended for training a Neural network, probably of the evolution variety, not Deep Q, to play foosball. It is currently somewhat commented, and this situation will be improved. TL;DR It's far from done, but is still a WIP
